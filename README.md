# Aircraft Operational Briefing Tool

The Aircraft Operational Briefing Tool project involves developing a Proof-of-Concept (POC) Augmented Reality (AR) prototype for CAE Australia. 

CAE is a high-tech company known for developing and delivering training and operational support solutions to global defence and security customers. 

They have achieved several achievements through their training systems and simulation hardware and now aims to introduce mixed reality for aircraft maintenance operations, briefing and training solution. 




## Project Description

This project was built using the [Unity engine](https://unity.com/)

The AR Prototype will be used by technicians and trainees as a supplementary tool for aircraft maintenance operations and support for maintenance briefings and trainings.

Its development is strongly aligned with their mission and vision, as its introduction would revolutionise their current maintenance and training technology with a digitally immersive solution through interactive AR elements.
